    <h1>Creative Coding (MART 120)</h1>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Week 1</h2>

    The first week was all about getting familiar with Github, making and moving repositories, and learning how to communicate with fellow classmates in the Github
    Issues section. Very simple stuff!

    <h2>Week 2</h2>

    For the second week, we watched a very motivational presentation by randy Pausch, a Professor of Computer Science who had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. 
    His presentation was very inspirational, and it taught me to be the best version of myself, approach the world with more optimism and to recognize the best 
    qualities of those around you. We also discussed the idea of the mindset, and having the confidence to strive and leap over the mental brick wall that often 
    gives people the idea that "I could never do that" or "I will never have enough skill for that". This weeks material was very helpful for me as it made me feel
    more optimism going forward in this class.

    We also went through the Dance Party Hour of Code certification and we created our first coding artpiece!

   <h2>Week 3</h2>
    For week 3, we began to dive into some very basic coding via Scratch, which was a very good way to test the waters of coding. 
    It was nothing too in-depth, but it was a great way to get a grasp on what coding is and how it works. We mostly learned about basic commands as well as loops 
    and collisions.
  <br>

   <h2>Week 4</h2>
    Week 4 was pretty similar to the material in week 3 as we got to work more with Scratch. We were given two assignments: make a basic phone app and and a simple
    game on Play Lab. The phone app that I made was a simple questionnaire with photos and buttons that navigated you between pages. You would end up on one of four
    or five pages depending on how you answered the questions that the app asked. It was a fun experience, and it was a good introduction to functions and events.
    The Play Lab game was very similar to the assignment we had in the previous week, and it was a good way to become more familiar with the basics. This assignment
    helped me wrap my head around if statements and variables.

   <h2>Week 5</h2>
   I was a little nervous at the beginning of week 5 when I was that we were going to be working with 3D environments and models using the program Alice 3. Despite that, 
   I ended up having a lot of fun on this assignment mostly because of how user-friendly the program was, and the course material did a great job explaining how everything
   works. The assignment got me more comfortable with moving and manipulating characters and objects as well as having them interact with each other. This week also covered
   fanctions and variables, but I do not believe I really used either in my completed assignment. I ended up telling a basic story using character movements, camera movements 
   and collisions.

   <h2>Week 6,7 and 8</h2>
   For weeks 6, 7 and 8, we learned all about HTML and building websites. Week 6 introduced us to the basic tags most frequently used when designing a website as well as
   the basic layout of HTML. This assignment taught me about hyperlinks, ordered and unordered lists, and HTML forms. My first page consists of my favorite restaurants,
   my favorite hobbies and my favorite websites.

   <br>
   Week 7 taught us about CSS and the different ways styles can be applied. We went over inline, embedded and external styles. We also went over class selecters and ID 
   selecters, which makes it easier to apply specific styles to certain tags. We also learned that we can use stylesheets made by other people, which is really cool.

   Unfortunately, week 8 was very busy for me and I did not complete the material for this week. I certainly do wish I was able to keep up during this week as it looks
   like a lot of valuable information was covered, such as form data retrieval, which I still do not know. But I will learn it! We also went further into if statements
   and for loops, but I luckily got to learn about those in later assignments.

   <h2>Week 9</h2>
   Week 9 taught us all about  how to set up the javascript library, p5.js. This is what gave me the toolset to create the silly self-portrait that you see below.
   The portrait is made up of simple shapes that I created and placed in specific spots using x,y coordinates. We also learned about the setup and draw functions 
   in javascript and how they work.

   <h2>Week 10</h2>
   For week 10, we took our portraits from the previous week and learned how to move the shapes using variables and a couple of new commands. We then learned how to
   stop and bounce shapes using if statements and if/else statements. We were also introduced to logical operators, which allows you to remove duplicated code and keep
   things looking nice and clean. We also glanced at the random math funtion, which helped me learn how the math funtions work in general.

   <h2>Week 11</h2>
   Week 11 went in-depth on conditional statements, logical operators and the differences between for loops and while loops in order to teach us how to properly apply
   them and be as efficient as possible. We were also introduced to event handling so we could make certain things occur when a certain key is pressed or when your mouse
   is either moved or clicked.

   <h2>Week 12</h2>
   Week 12 showed us how to create more functions and how to utilize them. I really enjoyed this week as these functions drastically helped me organize everything and 
   locate whatever I needed. Very helpful!

   <h2>Week 13</h2>
   Week 13 was all about arrays, and it may have been the toughest week for me. I am looking forward to the course next semester since we will be diving deeper into this. 
   I understand the purpose of arrays just fine, but I feel like there are more steps and moving parts compared to what we have done in the past, and I 
   feel like I will have a better understanding of arrays with more practice. I did just go through the material for this week once again and I feel like that helped.
